# Aura - Screen-Based Action Automation

## Overview
Aura is a Python-based automation tool that monitors screen conditions and executes keyboard actions based on those conditions. It integrates with World of Warcraft through a custom addon (AuraManager) and [WeakAuras2](https://github.com/WeakAuras/WeakAuras2) to automate actions based on in-game state indicators.

## WeakAuras Integration
This project integrates with [WeakAuras2](https://github.com/WeakAuras/WeakAuras2), a powerful World of Warcraft addon framework for displaying customizable graphics. Our integration:
- Creates compatible WeakAura definitions programmatically
- Uses WeakAuras' trigger system to detect game states
- Follows WeakAuras' addon structure and API conventions
- Maintains compatibility with WeakAuras version 78
- Leverages WeakAuras' display regions and animation system

### Template System
The project uses a strict template-based approach for WeakAura generation:
1. All visual properties come from `templates/sample.lua`
2. Individual auras MUST NOT modify visual properties
3. Only triggers and conditions should be customized
4. This ensures consistent appearance and behavior across all auras

## Core Components

### ScreenChecker (`src/core/screen_checker.py`)
- Monitors specific pixel colors on the screen
- Compares colors against defined conditions from a layout file
- Handles screen coordinate scaling for different resolutions
- Returns list of active conditions based on current screen state

### ScreenMonitor (`scripts/screen_monitor.py`)
- Main automation controller
- Loads action profiles and layout configurations
- Monitors gamepad input (right trigger) or keyboard ('r' key) for activation
- Executes keyboard actions when conditions are met

### AuraManager Addon (`AuraManager/`)
- Custom WoW addon that manages WeakAuras integration
- Provides in-game commands for WeakAura management:
  - `/am export` - Export auras to WeakAuras
  - `/am delete` - Delete all AuraManager auras
- Handles version compatibility with WeakAuras
- Manages combat lockdown restrictions
- Located in WoW's addon directory: `World of Warcraft/_retail_/Interface/AddOns/AuraManager`

### WeakAura Generation Tools

#### aura_generator.py
- Generates WeakAura Lua files using a template-based approach:
  1. Loads visual properties from `templates/sample.lua` (THE source of truth)
  2. Applies these consistent visual properties to all generated auras
  3. Only copies condition-specific information from each aura definition:
     - Triggers (what activates the aura)
     - Load conditions (when the aura should be loaded)
     - Class/spec restrictions
  4. Ensures all auras have consistent:
     - Visual appearance (size, colors, textures)
     - Animation settings
     - Frame properties
     - Sub-regions
  5. Any modifications to visual properties MUST be made in the template
- Creates grid-based layout for visual indicators
- Transforms WeakAuras data into addon-compatible format
- Outputs files to `AuraManager/auras/` directory
- Updates addon TOC file automatically

For example, when creating a new aura:
```lua
-- From templates/sample.lua (THE source of truth for visual properties)
-- DO NOT MODIFY THESE IN INDIVIDUAL AURAS
{
    width = 5,
    height = 5,
    frameStrata = 1,
    barColor = { 1, 0, 0, 1 },
    texture = "Solid",
    -- ... other visual settings
}

-- Your aura should ONLY define:
{
    triggers = {
        -- What activates this aura
    },
    load = {
        -- When to load this aura
    }
}
```

#### deploy_auras.py
- Copies generated WeakAuras to WoW's addon directory
- Ensures proper installation in SavedVariables
- Handles backup of existing WeakAuras
- Updates AuraManager configuration

#### import_bindings.py
- Imports key bindings configuration
- Maps in-game actions to keyboard keys
- Ensures consistency between WoW bindings and automation profiles

## Configuration Files

### Layout File (`scripts/layout.json`)
Defines screen locations and expected colors for various conditions:
```json
{
    "id": "power_40",
    "name": "Power 40%",
    "xOffset": 0,
    "yOffset": 0,
    "backgroundColor": {
        "r": 1.0,
        "g": 0.0,
        "b": 0.0,
        "a": 1.0
    }
}
```
- `id`: Unique identifier for the condition
- `xOffset/yOffset`: Position relative to screen center
- `backgroundColor`: Expected RGB color values (0.0-1.0)

### Profile Files (`scripts/profiles/*.json`)
Define actions and their required conditions:
```json
{
    "name": "Example Profile",
    "actions": [
        {
            "key": "1",
            "conditions": ["power_40", "combat", "enemy_in_melee_range"]
        }
    ]
}
```
- `key`: Keyboard key to press
- `conditions`: List of condition IDs that must be true for the action to trigger

### WeakAuras Files (`AuraManager/auras/*.lua`)
Generated WeakAura definitions that create visual indicators:
- Each file represents a different condition (power, health, combat status, etc.)
- Uses grid-based layout system for consistent positioning
- Includes triggers and conditions for state tracking
- Example conditions:
  - `power_*.lua`: Power level indicators (5%, 10%, 20%, etc.)
  - `health_below_*.lua`: Health threshold indicators
  - `combat.lua`: Combat state indicator
  - `enemy_*.lua`: Enemy-related conditions

## Usage

### Initial Setup
1. Run `aura_generator.py` to create WeakAura definitions
2. Run `deploy_auras.py` to install to WoW addon directory
3. Run `import_bindings.py` to configure key bindings
4. Start WoW and use `/am export` to load WeakAuras
5. Verify indicators are visible and positioned correctly

### Running the Monitor
```bash
python scripts/screen_monitor.py [options]

Options:
  --layout, -l    Path to layout JSON file (default: scripts/layout.json)
  --profile, -p   Path to profile JSON file (default: scripts/profiles/rogue.json)
  --debug, -d     Enable debug mode
```

### Controls
- Right Trigger (gamepad) or 'r' key: Hold to activate monitoring
- ESC: Exit the program

3. Update layout.json for new conditions
4. Create profiles for testing
5. Test WeakAura generation and deployment
6. Verify addon functionality in-game
7. Update WeakAura templates as needed

### Game State Expression
WeakAuras allows us to create visual indicators for various game states. Each state is represented by a colored region on screen that our monitor can detect:

#### Available State Types
1. Resource Levels
   - Power (Energy, Rage, Mana): Thresholds like 20%, 40%, 60%
   - Health: Below certain percentages
   - Combo Points: Specific numbers (1-5)
   - Holy Power, Soul Shards, etc.

2. Combat Status
   - In Combat
   - Target Selected
   - Enemy in Range
   - Spell Casting

3. Buffs and Debuffs
   - Player Buffs (Adrenaline Rush, Slice and Dice)
   - Target Debuffs (Rupture, Garrote)
   - Proc Effects (Clear Casting, Opportunity)

4. Cooldowns
   - Ability Ready/Not Ready
   - Buff/Debuff Duration Remaining
   - Time Until Resource Regeneration

Each state is configured in a WeakAura Lua file that:
1. Defines triggers for when the state is active
2. Creates a colored region at a specific screen position
3. Shows/hides based on the state being true/false

Example WeakAura for Power Level:
```lua
-- power_40.lua
{
    triggers = {
        {
            trigger = {
                type = "unit",
                unit = "player",
                use_powertype = true,
                powertype = 3, -- Energy
                use_percentpower = true,
                percentpower = "40",
                percentpower_operator = ">=",
            },
        },
    },
    load = {
        class = { ["ROGUE"] = true },
        use_combat = false,
    }
}
```

This creates a visual indicator that:
- Appears when Rogue energy >= 40%
- Shows at a specific position on screen
- Uses a consistent color we can detect
- Works in or out of combat
