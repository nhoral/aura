Getting Started with Aura
=======================

1. Python Setup
--------------
a) Check if Python is installed:
   - Open Command Prompt (Windows key + R, type "cmd", press Enter)
   - Type: python --version
   - You should see Python 3.11 or higher. If not, download from python.org
   - Note: If using Windows Store Python, use the alternative setup in step c)

b) Install Dependencies:
   - Open Command Prompt in the project folder (hold Shift + right-click in the folder, "Open PowerShell window here")
   - Run: pip install -r requirements.txt
   - If you get errors, try: python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

c) Install the Project:
   For standard Python installation:
   - In the same Command Prompt window
   - Run: python setup.py develop
   - This installs the project in development mode

   For Windows Store Python:
   - Run PowerShell as Administrator
   - Run: pip install -e .
   - Or alternatively, just run the project from the root directory
   - Make sure to always run scripts from the project root

   If you get permission errors:
   - Don't worry about installing in development mode
   - Just run all commands from the project root directory
   - Make sure the project root is in your PYTHONPATH:
     ```
     $env:PYTHONPATH = "C:\Users\YourUsername\path\to\aura;$env:PYTHONPATH"
     ```

2. World of Warcraft Setup
-------------------------
a) Find your WoW addon folder:
   - Usually at: C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns
   - If not there, open WoW, click 'Addons' in the character select screen, click 'Open Addon Folder'

b) Install WeakAuras:
   - Download WeakAuras from: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/weakauras-2
   - Extract to your WoW addon folder
   - Make sure you have version 3.7.8 or higher

c) Configure WoW paths:
   - Open config.py in a text editor
   - Update WOW_PATH to your WoW installation directory
   - Update the account name in WEAKAURAS_PATH (change "YABUCHI" to your account name)
   - Save the file

3. Setting Up Aura
-----------------
a) Deploy the AuraManager addon:
   - Run: python scripts/deploy_auras.py
   - This copies the addon to your WoW folder
   - You should see a "Deployment Summary" showing copied files
   - If it can't find your WoW folder, check the paths in config.py

b) Generate WeakAuras:
   - Run: python scripts/aura_generator.py
   - This creates the WeakAura Lua files
   - Check AuraManager/auras/ folder to verify files were created
   - The process might take a few minutes for many auras

c) Import the WeakAuras in-game:
   - Start World of Warcraft
   - Log into your character
   - Type: /am export
   - You should see a message that auras were imported
   - Type: /wa to open WeakAuras and verify they appear

4. Creating Your Own Auras
-------------------------
a) Understanding the layout:
   - Open scripts/layout.json
   - Each entry defines a screen position and color to check
   - Example:
     {
         "id": "power_40",
         "name": "Power 40%",
         "xOffset": 0,
         "yOffset": 0,
         "backgroundColor": {
             "r": 1.0,
             "g": 0.0,
             "b": 0.0,
             "a": 1.0
         }
     }

b) Creating action profiles:
   - Check scripts/profiles/ for examples
   - Each profile defines what keys to press when conditions are met
   - Example:
     {
         "name": "Example Profile",
         "actions": [
             {
                 "key": "1",
                 "conditions": ["power_40", "combat"]
             }
         ]
     }

5. Running the Monitor
---------------------
a) Basic usage:
   - Run: python scripts/screen_monitor.py
   - Hold right trigger on gamepad (or 'r' key) to activate
   - Press ESC to exit
   - Make sure WoW is in fullscreen windowed mode for best results

b) Using different profiles:
   - Run: python scripts/screen_monitor.py -p scripts/profiles/your_profile.json
   - Default profile is scripts/profiles/rogue.json

c) Debug mode:
   - Add --debug flag: python scripts/screen_monitor.py --debug
   - Shows detailed info about what's being detected

6. Common Issues
---------------
a) "Module not found" errors:
   - Make sure you ran pip install -r requirements.txt
   - Try running python with -m flag: python -m scripts.screen_monitor
3440 * 1.875 x 1440 / 768 -> 3840 x 2160
b) WeakAuras not showing:
   - Type /reload in WoW
   - Check if WeakAuras addon is enabled
   - Try /am export again
   - Verify your account name in config.py is correct

c) Actions not triggering:
   - Run in debug mode to see what's being detected
   - Check your profile JSON for correct condition names
   - Verify WeakAuras are visible and in correct positions
   - Make sure you're in fullscreen windowed mode

d) Screen detection issues:
   - Make sure WoW is in fullscreen windowed mode
   - Check layout.json coordinates match WeakAura positions
   - Try running in debug mode to see color values
   - Adjust your UI scale if needed

e) Deployment errors:
   - Check WoW path in config.py
   - Make sure WoW is closed during deployment
   - Run deploy_auras.py with --debug flag
   - Check permissions on WoW addon folder

7. Useful Commands
-----------------
- Generate auras: python scripts/aura_generator.py
- Deploy addon: python scripts/deploy_auras.py
- Run monitor: python scripts/screen_monitor.py
- Import bindings: python scripts/import_bindings.py
- In-game commands:
  - /am export : Export auras to WeakAuras
  - /am delete : Delete all AuraManager auras
  - /wa : Open WeakAuras interface

8. File Structure
----------------
Important files you might need to edit:
- config.py : Configure WoW directory path and account name
- scripts/layout.json : Define screen positions to check
- scripts/profiles/*.json : Define action profiles
- AuraManager/auras/ : Generated WeakAura files

Remember:
- Always run scripts from the project root directory
- Keep WeakAuras addon updated
- Back up your profiles before making changes
- Use debug mode if something's not working
- Make sure WoW is in fullscreen windowed mode
- Update config.py with your specific paths
