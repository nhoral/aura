Building Auras in WeakAuras for Conditions

General Instructions

1. Identify the Condition:
   - Determine the specific condition you need to detect in the game.
   - Example: Detect if the player is not behind the target when attempting to use Backstab.

2. Choose the Appropriate Event:
   - Review the available events in World of Warcraft to find the most suitable event for detecting the condition.

3. Create the Custom Function:
   - Write a custom function that listens to the chosen event and checks the relevant arguments to determine if the condition is met.
   - Use print statements to troubleshoot and verify that the event is being detected correctly.

4. Implement the WeakAura:
   - Open the WeakAura addon in World of Warcraft.
   - Create a new aura and select "Custom" as the type.
   - Set the trigger type to "Event" and specify the event.
   - Copy and paste the custom function into the custom function field.
   - Set the custom hide option and load conditions as needed.
   - Save the WeakAura with an appropriate name.

Example: Creating the "not_behind_target" Aura

1. Identify the Condition:
   - Condition: Detect if the player is not behind the target when attempting to use Backstab.

2. Choose the Appropriate Event:
   - Event: `UI_ERROR_MESSAGE`
   - This event is triggered when an error message is displayed in the game.

3. Create the Custom Function:
   - Custom Function:
     ```lua
     function(event, arg1, arg2)
         if event == "UI_ERROR_MESSAGE" and string.find(arg2, "be behind your") then
             return true
         end
         return false
     end
     ```

4. Implement the WeakAura:
   - Open WeakAura Addon: Type `/wa` in the chat to open the WeakAura interface.
   - Create a New Aura: Click on "New" to create a new aura and select "Custom" as the type.
   - Set Trigger Type: Set the trigger type to "Event".
   - Set Event: Set the event to "UI_ERROR_MESSAGE".
   - Custom Function: Copy and paste the custom function into the custom function field.
   - Custom Hide: Set the custom hide option to "Timed" and the duration to 1 second.
   - Load Conditions: Set the load conditions to ensure the WeakAura is only active for the Rogue class.
     - Check "Class" and select "Rogue".
   - Save the WeakAura: Save the WeakAura with an appropriate name, such as "NotBehindTargetCheck".

Next Steps

1. Test the WeakAura: Ensure it correctly detects the condition in the game.
2. Integrate into Profile: Once the WeakAura is confirmed to be working, integrate it into your profile as needed.
3. Iterate and Improve: Continue to build and refine WeakAuras for other conditions as needed.
